# OriginsPlus
This repository is a compilation of custom origins made for the GalaxySMP Origins server. 

The official Modpack is posted on Curseforge for download:
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/galaxy-origins-plus
(This datapack requires pehkui for the scaling Origins to work)
If you need help with installation I recommend using this link https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

If I can find a way I'll look into adding the datapack manually into the curseforge launcher.

I will not be maintaining this repository, unless people want me to.
These origins were made for the intention to be fun; not necessarily balanced.

If you have questions on how I implemented these features you are free to ask.
This Mod was really fun to play with and if anyone is thinking about getting into Minecraft development, I highly recommend
using this as a starting place.

Rights and Credit goes to those that have worked on their corresponding works.
This repository is public and free of use, however I will shut down the repository if people decide to distribute it
for pay without my consent.

Thanks to Origin Teams and the other Mod Creators that helped make this happen!

Make sure to run /reload in game with the datapack to ensure that all needed systems are in place.


Feel free to reach out if you have questions or requests!
